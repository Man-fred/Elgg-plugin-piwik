This is the Piwik version of the Google Analytics Elgg. In this version you only need
to copy this folder over to your Elgg mod directory and then enable the plugin.

Afterwards there will be a section in the Admin page called Piwik. From here you can input
your Piwik tracking ID.

I made this plugin much more advanced than I needed to, but it was the first plugin I had written 
for Elgg and I used it as a good learning experience (plus I was stuck in an airport for a few hours :-P)

Thanks for using my plugins! I hope they're useful to you.
